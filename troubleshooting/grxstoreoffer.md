If you happen to get this Engine Error, it means your `scripts\` folder is in the wrong location or it does not exist.

Make sure the path to your scripts folder is `platform\scripts\`, and that you properly extracted the contents of [scripts\_r5](https://github.com/Mauler125/scripts_r5) in it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Double check if you made a typo, if the folder isn't called `scripts`it won't work and it will throw the Engine Error above.
{% endhint %}

![If your path and the contents of the scripts folder look similar it should be good!](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)
