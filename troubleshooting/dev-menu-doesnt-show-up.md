# 无法打开开发者菜单

如果您试图在游戏中使用“Dev Menu”（开发者菜单），但无论按什么键，它都不显示，这可能是因为您的游戏路径太长。

Try moving your game folder out of any directories you have it in, so the path to it is way shorter. For example:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

This also fixes any problems you would have with your loading config files.

The dev menu should now appear in the `ESC` menu as long as you have launched the dev build.
