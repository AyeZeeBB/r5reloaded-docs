# 无法打开开发者菜单

If you are trying to enable the DEV menu for yourself but it still won't show up no matter what you do, it might be because the path to your game is too long.

Try moving your game folder out of any directories you have it in, so the path to it is way shorter. For example:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

This also fixes any problems you would have with your loading config files.

The dev menu should now appear in the `ESC` menu as long as you have launched the dev build.
